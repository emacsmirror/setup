`setup.el`
==========

The `setup` macro simplifies repetitive configuration patterns, by
providing context-sensitive local macros in `setup` bodies.

For example, these macros:

~~~elisp
(setup shell
  (let ((key (kbd "C-c s")))
    (:global key shell)
    (:bind key bury-buffer)))

(setup dired
  (:also-load dired-x)
  (:option (prepend dired-guess-shell-alist-user) '("" "xdg-open")
           dired-dwim-target t)
  (:hook auto-revert-mode))

(setup (:package paredit)
  (:hide-mode)
  (:hook-into scheme-mode lisp-mode))
~~~

will be replaced with the functional equivalent of

~~~elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") #'shell)
(with-eval-after-load 'shell
  (define-key shell-mode-map (kbd "C-c s") #'bury-buffer))

(with-eval-after-load 'dired
  (require 'dired-x))
(customize-set-variable 'dired-guess-shell-alist-user
                        (cons '("" "xdg-open")
			      dired-guess-shell-alist-user))
(customize-set-variable 'dired-dwim-target t)
(add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'auto-revert-mode)

(unless (package-install-p 'paredit)
  (package-install 'paredit))
(setq minor-mode-alist
      (delq (assq 'paredit-mode minor-mode-alist)
            minor-mode-alist))
(add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook #'paredit-mode)
(add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook #'paredit-mode)
~~~

Additional "keywords" can be defined using `setup-define`. All known
keywords are documented in the docstring for `setup`.

Installation
------------

`setup.el` is part of [GNU ELPA][elpa], and can be installed using
`package.el`.

Usage
-----

The `setup` macro is autoloaded, and can be used directly.  The code
generated by `setup` does not depend on `setup.el`, meaning that your
initialization file can be byte-compiled more efficiently.
